   October 18, 2022
 
 
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This guide provides brief instructions on how to do SPICE ``Remote
   Sensing'' (CASSINI, ExoMars 2016, and KPLO), ``In-situ Sensing'',
   ``Geometric Event Finding'' (Mars Express, ExoMars 2016, and KPLO), and
   ``Binary PCK'' hands-on lessons using the SPICE WebGeocalc (WGC) tool.
 
   Instructions for each lesson are provided in a separate section below.
   They follow the lesson steps and individual assignments within each
   step, indicate which WGC computation panels (``calculations'') should be
   used and what inputs should be entered or selected in these
   calculations, and what key outputs should be expected from WGC. Where
   applicable, they indicate that a particular quantity computed in the
   lesson cannot be computed by WGC.

   WGC does not have a separate calculation to compute angles between
   directions to objects and instrument boresights or axes of a reference
   frame, making such computations not possible in general. But for cases
   when the axis is ``Z'' such computations can be done using the ``State
   Vector'' calculation with the ``Spherical Coordinates'' output, in which
   the colatitude is equal to the desired angle.
 
   To compute the angular separation between the apparent position of Earth
   and the CASSINI high gain antenna (HGA) boresight, specify/select the
   following inputs in the ``State Vector'' calculation:
 
      Target                    EARTH

   WGC will return the following latitude and longitude, deg, and radius,
   km:
 
      3.70986500
      23.42331102

   WGC does not allow computing planetodetic and planetographic coordinates
   on bodies that are tri-axial ellipsoids with different equatorial radii.
   Choosing the planetographic coordinates for output will result in the
   following error message:
 
      Reference frame center is not a spheroid. Planetodetic and
      planetographic coordinate representations can only be
      calculated for bodies with equal equatorial axes. The center
      body of the reference frame, PHOEBE, has equatorial axes
      that differ, 115.0 and 110.0. Use planetocentric coordinates
      instead.

   To compute the apparent state of Mars as seen from TGO in the IAU_MARS
   body-fixed frame, specify/select the following inputs in the ``State

   WGC will return the following state vector, km and km/s:
 
      -2843.46412456

      0.31144328
      -1.15192925
      3.08212262
 
   WGC does not have a separate calculation to compute angles between
   directions to objects and instrument boresights or axes of a reference
   frame, making such computations not possible in general. But for cases
   when the axis is ``Z'' such computations can be done using the ``State
   Vector'' calculation with the ``Spherical Coordinates'' output, in which
   the colatitude is equal to the desired angle. Since the nominal
   instrument view direction is the ``-Y'' axis of the ``TGO_SPACECRAFT''
   frame we cannot use this approach with this frame but we can use it with
   the ``TGO_NOMAD_LNO_NAD'' frame which has its ``Z'' axis along the view
   direction.
 
   To compute the angular separation between the apparent position of Mars
   and the TGO nominal instrument view direction, specify/select the
   following inputs in the ``State Vector'' calculation:

   WGC will return the following output colatitude, deg:
 
      130.54279733
 
   This angle is greater than 90 degrees so the science deck is not
   illuminated.

   WGC does not allow computing planetodetic and planetographic coordinates
   on bodies that are tri-axial ellipsoids with different equatorial radii.
   Choosing the planetographic coordinates for output will result in the
   following error message:
 
      Reference frame center is not a spheroid. Planetodetic and
      planetographic coordinate representations can only be
      calculated for bodies with equal equatorial axes. The center
      body of the reference frame, PHOBOS, has equatorial axes
      that differ, 13.0 and 11.4. Use planetocentric coordinates
      instead.

      -0.54249964
      -0.35188864
      1.51918815
 
   WGC does not have a separate calculation to compute angles between
   directions to objects and instrument boresights or axes of a reference
   frame, making such computations not possible in general. But for cases
   when the axis is ``Z'' such computations can be done using the ``State
   Vector'' calculation with the ``Spherical Coordinates'' output, in which
   the colatitude is equal to the desired angle. Since the nominal
   instrument view direction is the ``+Z'' axis of the ``KPLO_SPACECRAFT''
   frame we can use this approach.
 
   To compute the angular separation between the apparent position of Moon
   and the KPLO nominal instrument view direction, specify/select the
   following inputs in the ``State Vector'' calculation:

``In-situ Sensing'' Hands-On Lesson Using WGC
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Kernels Used
 
   Use the ``SPICE Class - In-situ Sensing Lesson Kernels'' kernel set
   appearing near the bottom of the ``Kernel selection:'' menu to do all
   steps in this lesson.
 
 
Step-1: ``UTC to ET''
 
   To compute ET seconds past J2000 for a given UTC string, specify/select
   the following inputs in the ``Time Conversion'' calculation:
 
      Time system               UTC
      Time format               Calendar date and time
      Input time                2004-06-11T19:32:00
      Output time system        TDB
      Output time format        Seconds past J2000
 
   WGC will return the following ET seconds past J2000:
 
      140254384.184620
 
 
Step-2: ``SCLK to ET''
 
   To compute ET seconds past J2000 for a given SCLK string, specify/select
   the following inputs in the ``Time Conversion'' calculation:
 
      Time system               Spacecraft clock (SCLK=-82)
      Time format               Spacecraft clock string
      Input time                1465674964.105
      Output time system        TDB
      Output time format        Seconds past J2000
 
   WGC will return the following ET seconds past J2000:
 
      140254384.183430
 
   Either the input SCLK time or these output ET seconds past J2000 should
   be used as the input time in all remaining ``In-situ Sensing'' lesson
   steps in order for WGC to compute values matching the results provided
   in the programming lesson. The output ET seconds may be saved for future
   use in the WGC ``Saved Values'' area by simply clicking on them with the
   left mouse button. The saved value can then be drag-n-dropped from the
   ``Saved Values'' area into the empty ``Time:'' box in the next
   calculation.
 
 
Step-3: ``Spacecraft State''
 
   To compute the geometric state of the CASSINI spacecraft with respect to
   the Sun in the Ecliptic frame, specify/select the following inputs in
   the ``State Vector'' calculation:

Kernels Used
 
   Use the ``SPICE Class - Mars Express Geometric Event Finding Lesson
   Kernels'' kernel set appearing near the bottom of the ``Kernel
   selection:'' menu to do all steps in this lesson.
 
   Make sure to unload the ``Ground Stations Kernels'' kernel set if it is
   pre-loaded by default as this kernel set contains a duplicate definition
   of the ``DSS-14_TOPO'' frame that may trigged a SPICE error if loaded
   together with the lesson kernel set.
